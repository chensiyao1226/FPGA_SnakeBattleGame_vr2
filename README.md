This project is the upgrade version of classic snake battle game on FPGA board, connected to two 8-key directional keypads, an LCD display, and a buzzer. 
Two players can control their snakes using the keypads, vying for apples on the screen. 
The game ends for players who collide with others or their own snake bodies, introducing a strategic element to consume more apples. 
Players can also use their elongating bodies to encircle their opponents, aiming for victory through tactical positioning and movement.
